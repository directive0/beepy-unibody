A simple unibody enclosure that fully encases the PCB. Ports are accessible via the front cap. Uses M2 screws for securing.

if you print and assemble take care installing the PCB. Its easy to snag the keys on the keyboard while sliding it into place. Also make sure the side button is seated fully into its slot; if you aren't careful you can shear off the side button component as you slide the PCB in and will need to repair it (trust me I did it).
